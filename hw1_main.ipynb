    "- *how you would want me to address you (do you have preferred pronouns?) and if the proper pronunciation of your name?*\n",
    "    - You can address me as Sean or he/him/his pronouns! The pronunication is sh-on.\n",
    "- *your educational and professional background?*\n",
    "    - I graduated with my BS in Computer Science and BA in Linguistics from the Univerity of Pittsburgh in 2022. I started as a full-time Software Engineer with the MITRE Corporation in 2022. My first year I built software to support Reinforcement Learning research, but now I lead an Explainable AI research project and work on a Federated Learning project. I love building things and I love AI. I am drawn to Statistics because it can serve as a new perspective into concepts I'm already familiar with. Specifically I would like to learn more about Bayesian approaches and optimization!\n",
    "- *your experience with computing and specifically statistical computing?*\n",
    "    - Coding is my day job, though I'm always looking to learn more. I know a decent bit about High Performance Computing and relevant topics like parallelization, and I'm familiar with tools like Slurm and htop.\n",
    "- *your proficiency with R and any other programming language you know?*\n",
    "    - I have experience with Python, Julia, and R (in that order) but also some other languages like Java, C, PDDL, and Javascript. I would feel comfortable using R if necessary, but I prefer Python because it has OOP, lots of documentation, and lots of libraries.\n",
    "- *anything you would want me to know about yourself or your background?*\n",
    "    - My biggest area of weakness with respect to this class will likely be the statistical concepts themselves, which I am very excited to work on! I hope that I'm able to help others with computing concepts in exchange for help with statistics concepts."
